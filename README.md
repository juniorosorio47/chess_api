# Chess possible movements API
This is an API that returns a list of possible movements for a given piece on board 8x8. The coordinates are defined following the Algebraic Notation.  

# Setup API:
To run this project in your computer you have 2 options:  
1. With Docker and docker-compose: Runs 2 docker images: The API and the database (MySQL).  
2. With Python and a MySQL database. **Note:** docker-compose option already do everything, thats magic ü™Ñ.  

## 1 - Docker
If you already have docker and docker-compose installed, you can just run:
```sh
docker-compose up
```

Login to docker container using ("api" is the name of the service in docker-compose.yaml):
```sh
docker-compose exec api /bin/bash
```

Create the migrations:
```sh
python manage.py makemigrations
```
Migrate:
```sh
python manage.py migrate
```

## 2 - Python and MySQL:
You should have MySQL installed and insert the database informations at **chess_api/settings.py**

Create the migrations:
```sh
python manage.py makemigrations
```

Migrate:
```sh
python manage.py migrate
```

Run server:
```sh
python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000
```

# Here is how to use the API:

## Add a piece to the board:
First of all, you need to add the piece to the board.  
You can make a POST request to:  
```
http://localhost:8000/api/chess/piece/add
```

Your request body should have the following parameters to create a piece (the values are not case sensitive):  
```json
{
    //You can send the type in 2 ways: with the key or name. These are described below.
    "type":"knight", // or "N"
    "color":"black" // or "white"
}
```

### Possible types:  

| Name | Key | Possible Movements |
|---|---|---|
| Pawn  | P  |  1 or 2 spaces forward |
| Rook  | R  | anywhere in the same rank or same file  |
| Knight  | N  |  2 in one direction and 1 in the other ‚ÄúL-shaped‚Äù |
| Bishop  |  B | diagonally, any distance  |
| Queen  | Q  |  horizontal, vertical or diagonal, any distance |
| King  |  K | 1 space in any direction  |


### The response from the API route **/api/chess/piece/add** should be like this:

```json
{
	"id": 1,
	"color": "white",
	"key": "n",
	"name": "knight"
}
```

---

## Get the possible movements:
After created at least one piece, you can make a GET request to the following url to get the possible movements:

```
http://localhost:8000/api/chess/piece/movements
```

You need to send the **piece_id** and **coordinate** (in [Algebraic notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_notation_(chess))) of the piece.  
If the piece is a **Knight (N)**, the API will return the possible movements within **2 turns**. If its another piece it will return the possible movements for 1 turn.  

For instance: The Knight I created is at the coordinate H6 on an empty board, and I want to know what are the possible movements. So I will make a request informing the piece_id and  coordinate.  

I need to make a GET request with the body:  
```json
{
    // Piece id received on the piece creation
    "piece_id":1,
    // Current coordinates of my piece
    "coordinate":"h4"
}
```

### The response from the API route **/api/chess/piece/move** should be like this:
```json
{
	"piece": {
		"id": 1,
		"color": "black",
		"key": "n",
		"name": "knight"
	},
	"possible_moves": [
		"g6",
		"f5",
		"f3",
		"g2"
	],
	"second_turn": [
		{
			"g6": [
				"h4",
				"h8",
				"f8",
				"e7",
				"e5",
				"f4"
			]
		},
		{
			"f5": [
				"g3",
				"h4",
				"h6",
				"g7",
				"e7",
				"d6",
				"d4",
				"e3"
			]
		},
		{
			"f3": [
				"g1",
				"h2",
				"h4",
				"g5",
				"e5",
				"d4",
				"d2",
				"e1"
			]
		},
		{
			"g2": [
				"h4",
				"f4",
				"e3",
				"e1"
			]
		}
	]
}
```
